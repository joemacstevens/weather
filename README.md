## Simple Weather

A simple weather app built with React using the Open Weather API and WeatherBit Api.



### Why?

For one, to further my understanding of React by building something that wasn't assigned in a course or code challenge 

Secondly to further my understanding of CSS Grid and how it makes creating layouts easier.
